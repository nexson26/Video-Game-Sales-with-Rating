(Credit to original uploader and Kaggle community)



The dataset contains information on 11,563 video games, including details such as genre, Japan sales, US sales, and more. However, the data has significant missing values and unnecessary information. My task was to clean the data, remove irrelevant columns, and demonstrate that Role-Playing games have higher mean global sales than Action games.

How to use:

1.Open the file "Final report â€“ explanation with all details.pdf". It explains all the steps taken to achieve my goal.

2.All the Rprogram code is provided in file "video_game_data-coding.R".
